                I had the opportunity to develop comprehensive healthcare web and mobile
                applications focused on calorie management. The applications encompassed a wide
                range of features, including advanced calorie calculation, social interaction and
                community engagement, expert consultation, secure payment processing, and
                in-depth analytics. To bring these ideas to life, I utilized cutting-edge technologies
                such as React for web development, React Native for mobile application development,
                and Node.js for robust backend support. It was a fulfilling experience to contribute to
                the health and wellness domain by creating user-friendly, feature-rich applications
                aimed at helping individuals lead healthier lives.
